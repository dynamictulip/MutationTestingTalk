# Mutation testing isn't infallible

- It won't catch bugs
- The more mutations you run, the longer it takes

# But it can help

- Give you more trust in your tests and hence your system
- Highlight scenarios that you haven't thought about - especially for complicated tests!
- Show redundant code
- Train you to write better tests
